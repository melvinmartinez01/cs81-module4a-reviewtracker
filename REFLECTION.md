## Reflection
The most helpful aspect of this code's structure was how the array was set up and stored, which made it loop through, and analyze the data in a different way.
The part that took me the longest was trying to understand each function fully, since I had to sit and read, as well as, look up what each function is to ensure that I actually knew the definition.
